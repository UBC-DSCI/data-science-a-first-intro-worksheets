# Round double to precise integer
#
# `int_round` works to create an integer corresponding to a number that is 
# tested up to a particular decimal point of precision. This is useful when 
# there is a need to compare a numeric value using hashes.
#
# @param x Double vector of length one.
# @param digits Double vector of length one to specify decimal point of precision. Negative numbers can be used to specifying significant digits > 0.1.
#
# @return Integer vector of length one corresponding to a particular decimal point of precision.
#
# @examples
# # to get an integer up to two decimals of precision from 234.56789
# int_round(234.56789, 2)
#
# to get an integer rounded to the hundred digit from 234.56789
# int_round(234.56789, -2)
